# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of Project  

**Purpose:**  
The purpose of this project is to use different models of supervised machine learning to predict credit risk for loans.  

## Resources:  
- Data Source: LoanStats_2019Q1.csv  
- Software: Anaconda 4.10.3, Python 3.9.7, Jupyter Notebook 6.4.5, scikit-learn 0.24.2, imbalanced-learn 0.7.0  

## Analysis and Results  

**Analysis:**  
The following models were used for this project:  
- Logistic Regression - Random Oversampling  
- Logistic Regression - SMOTE Oversampling  
- Logistic Regression - Undersampling  
- Logistic Regression - SMOTEEN Combined Over and Undersampling  
- Balanced Random Forest Classifier  
- Easy Ensemble Classifier  

The following calculations per formered for each model of analysis:  
- Accuracy Score  
- Precision  
- Recall/Sensitivity  
- F1 Score  

**Results:**
